## HELLO!!!

 I'm Aaska :)
 
 First-semester Computer Science student at Leeds Beckett University. I am curious about Python 🐍 and enjoy building small projects, while also passionate about learning programming through hands-on practice and exploring new ideas. I am always eager to improve skills and take on new challenges. I am also active on social medias.
